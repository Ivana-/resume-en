 * 2006 – Sep 2017:
Self-employed Freelance Software Engineer. A full cycle of services for setting up and implementing 1C (russian accounting framework) software products - from document management and financial accounting to the implementation of software products and the development of unique configurations for its maintenance. Interconnection of accounting systems with trade and other equipment, organization of migration / exchange of information between different systems.

Chief Technical Architect at ART-COM (Voronezh Region, Russian Federation) - 1C Franchisee. Programmer -> Project Manager -> Head of Implementation Department. I was engaged in the tasks of the full cycle of automation of enterprises accounting: communication with customers, collecting / analyzing information, formalizing the tasks, drawing up a technical task, assigning tasks to performers, monitoring the progress of work, independent participation in responsible projects, delivery of work to customers.


In parallel with the main work I studied other languages ​​and programming paradigms: OOP (Java, C#), FP (Haskell, Scheme, F#, Clojure), programming of microcontrollers (Asm, C), mathematical modeling (Matlab), etc. Project examples:

**Clojure:** several recent github projects - https://github.com/Ivana-?tab=repositories 
Of interest may be noted universal REPL-based debugger with breakpoints https://github.com/Ivana-/bb-debug, solution of the stack overflow problem in Clojure https://github.com/Ivana-/naso, universal frontend to the any server implementing FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) API and information processing https://github.com/Ivana-/fhir-face, a couple of mathematical modeling tasks with a graphical user interface https://github.com/Ivana-/star-dance, https://github.com/Ivana-/relay-control-demo, etc.
About code text - I can follow any company code and comments style in work projects

**Java:** implemented an interpreter of my own functional Lisp-like language called Liscript with GUI-REPL https://github.com/Ivana-/Liscript-GUI-Java-Swing

**WEB:** developed a web-based Liscript: online REPL interpreter interface, as well as a REPL bot interpreter in popular messengers (IRC, Telegram, Slack, Gitter. Frontend - Javascript / jquery, backend - Java / Ratpack). Main page address https://liscript.herokuapp.com/

**Haskell:** wrote an alternative implementation of the Liscript interpreter https://github.com/Ivana-/Liscript and other pet-projects, graduated with honors from 2 courses on Stepic educational platform, reached level 2 kyu on the website of olympiad tasks Codewars https://www.codewars.com/users/Ivana

**Asm/C:** developed the software part of the electromagnetic relay parameter meter (switching time and contact jitter) - a real-time measurement system on a microcontroller

**С#:** wrote a demonstration-training program - a lambda-terms reducer with a choice of the normal / applicative reduction strategy and a demonstration of the sequence of reduction steps

**Matlab:** developed the author's algorithm for local polynomial spline interpolation, which has a lower computational complexity compared with analogues with comparable quality characteristics. The algorithm became part of the operating software for real hardware complex.
